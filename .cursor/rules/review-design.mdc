@docs/skills/review-design/SKILL.md contains the full skill specification. Read and follow it completely.

The user's request is to review the design doc for "$ARGUMENTS".

Follow all phases in order:
1. Phase 0: Load the design doc, extract references
2. Phase 1: Audit codebase against design using the review checklist
3. Phase 2: Quiz loop — present discrepancies, get user decisions, repeat until clean
4. Phase 3: Final verification of the updated design doc

Do NOT auto-fix discrepancies. Always ask the user first.
