@docs/skills/design-feature/SKILL.md contains the full skill specification. Read and follow it completely.

The user's request is to design the feature "$ARGUMENTS".

Follow all phases in order:
1. Phase 0: Quiz the user for requirements (8 questions)
2. Phase 1: Explore the codebase using the subsystem map
3. Phase 2: Write the design doc to docs/
4. Phase 3: Break into concrete implementation tasks

Do NOT skip the quiz phase. Do NOT start designing without all answers.
