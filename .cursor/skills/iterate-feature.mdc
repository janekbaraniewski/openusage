@docs/skills/iterate-feature/SKILL.md contains the full skill specification. Read and follow it completely.

The user's request is to iterate on the feature "$ARGUMENTS".

Follow all phases in order:

2. Phase 1: Triage issues by priority (P0–P3)
3. Phase 2: Plan iterations with approach and risk
4. Phase 3: Execute fixes with per-fix verification
5. Phase 4: Re-validate (build, tests, design compliance)
6. Phase 5: Iteration summary with verdict
