# Skill: Develop Feature

> **Invocation**: When a user asks to build, develop, or ship a complete feature end-to-end.

Read and follow the full skill specification in `docs/skills/develop-feature/SKILL.md`.

The user's request is to develop a feature through the full lifecycle.

This orchestrates all phases:
1. Phase 0: Intake — check for existing design doc, confirm scope
2. Phase 1: Design (design-feature skill)
3. Phase 2: Review (review-design skill)
4. Phase 3: Implement (implement-feature skill)
5. Phase 4: Validate (validate-feature skill)
6. Phase 5: Iterate (iterate-feature skill)
7. Phase 6: Finalize (finalize-feature skill)
8. Phase 7: Summary

Pause for user confirmation between each phase.
