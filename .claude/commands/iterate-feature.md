Iterate on the feature "$ARGUMENTS" to fix issues and address feedback.

Read and follow the full skill specification in docs/skills/iterate-feature/SKILL.md.

Follow all phases in order:

1. **Phase 0 — Load Context**: Find the design doc for "$ARGUMENTS". Gather feedback sources (validation report, PR comments, user feedback). Read changed files.

2. **Phase 1 — Triage**: Categorize all issues by priority (P0 Bug → P3 Polish). Present list and confirm scope.

3. **Phase 2 — Plan Iterations**: Plan each fix with files, approach, risk. Identify parallel fixes. Wait for approval.

4. **Phase 3 — Execute Iterations**: Fix each issue: read → fix → test → diagnose → verify. Report per-fix status. Flag regressions or design changes.

5. **Phase 4 — Re-validate**: Run build, tests, vet. Confirm design compliance. Loop back if failures found.

6. **Phase 5 — Iteration Summary**: Report all changes, design doc updates, re-validation results, and verdict.
